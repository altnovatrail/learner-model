# names are the same in every Go repository of NovaTrail, and what they run is this repository's

# module, as module-kit's justfile runs them, so nothing is installed for it and go.mod gains no
# require: the Go module proxy serves that version and the checksum database vouches for it.

# The coverage goes into coverage/go.out, one Go profile, which the job coverage of .github's shared
# go.yml sends to Codecov (R48 spec; R13). Go counts statements and leaves the tests themselves out;
# a package that no test runs is in it too, its statements at zero. Every test counts for every
# package of the module, -coverpkg=./...: a test of golden vectors runs the code of other packages,
# and its lines count where they are.
# Then come the checks of the same bits on every build (R09): the tests on the builds where the bits
# are most at risk, and the comparison of the assembler with and without fusion.
