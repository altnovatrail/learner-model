# learner-model's own recipes. The ci- ones are what .github's shared go.yml runs, one job each, in
# the toolchain stage of .devcontainer/Dockerfile (R16 .github; R13 in docs/decisions.md): their
# names are the same in every Go repository of NovaTrail, and what they run is this repository's
# own.

# The tools only the checks need, at exact versions. Each is a Go program run straight from its
# module, as module-kit's justfile runs them, so nothing is installed for it and go.mod gains no
# require: the Go module proxy serves that version and the checksum database vouches for it.
# Dependabot does not see them, so they are raised by hand.
